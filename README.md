# noDoc
noDoc - automatic JavaDoc generation for IntelliJ

Generate documentation fluff - automatically produces awful JavaDoc for methods from code, saving you time when implementing harsh corporate coding standards.

You should feel terrible when adding this useless documentation (this "no documentation"), but at least you're keeping to standards, right?

Click on "noDoc" in the main menu, then click "Add no documentation" to populate the current file. This will not overwrite existing documentation for each method.
